# U-net-for-the-segmentation-of-cell-images

U-net (Ronneberger et al., (2015) is a Fully Convolutional Network for supervised image segmentation.U-net expands upon Fully Convolutional Neural networks (FCN) to yield a network that doesnâ€™t require a large number of
training examples while producing better segmentations.
